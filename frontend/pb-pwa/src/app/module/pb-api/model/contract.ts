Please contact us at helmut.spindler@inercomp.com    ## Endpoints The Powerbot Trading REST API is available at the following REST endpoints:  | Instance                | Base URL for REST Endpoints                     | |-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------| | Test                    | https://playground.powerbot-trading.com/api/v0  | | Staging, Production     | Provided on request                     |  Access to endpoints is secured via an API Key, which needs to be passed as an  \"api_key\" header in each request.     Notes on API Keys:  * API keys are specific to Test, Staging or Production.  * An API key is associated with a user account and needs to requested. Please contact us by email at helmut.spindler@inercomp.com to request an API key.  ## Errors The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of the API call. The body of the response will be in JSON format as follows:  ``` {   \"message\": \"... an error message ...\" } ```  ## Paging The API uses offset and limit parameters for paged operations.

This allows cross-domain communication from the browser. All responses have a wildcard same-origin which makes them completely public and accessible to everyone, including any code on any site.  ## Additional code samples Additional information and code samples demonstrating the use of the API can be found at https://github.com/powerbot-trading/python-samples.
